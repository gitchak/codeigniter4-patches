# DEPRECATED

This version of the library (as a `spark` command and PHP module) is deprecated. See the
release notes for `v1.2` for more details.

# Tatter\Patches
Module for updating CodeIgniter 4 projects

[![](https://github.com/tattersoftware/codeigniter4-patches/workflows/PHP%20Unit%20Tests/badge.svg)](https://github.com/tattersoftware/codeigniter4-patches/actions?query=workflow%3A%22PHP+Unit+Tests%22)

## Quick Start

1. Install with Composer: `> composer require --dev tatter/patches`
2. Use the command to update: `> php spark selfupdate`

## Description

**Patches** helps keep your CodeIgniter 4 projects up-to-date when there are framework or
other upstream changes that affect your project source. Use one easy command to patch your
development instance and update dependencies all at once.

### Process

The library will initialize and locate any source files in **{namespace}/Patches**. Legacy
files identified by the source files are copied into the workspace prior to running the update.
After running updates (e.g. the equivalent of `composer update`) any files that changed are
compared with their equivalent version in your project root. Any eligible files are automatically
merged and then you are guided through conflict resolution in cases where a file could not be
merged automatically.

## Installation

Install easily via Composer to take advantage of CodeIgniter 4's autoloading capabilities
and always be up-to-date:
* `> composer require --dev tatter/patches`

Or, install manually by downloading the source files and adding the directory to
`app/Config/Autoload.php`.

**Note:** While **Patches** can be run in a production environment it is strongly recommended
that you install it in development (using `--dev`) and then apply changes manually to production.

## Configuration

The library's default behavior can be altered by extending its config file. Copy
**bin/Patches.php** to **app/Config/** and follow the instructions
in the comments. If no config file is found in **app/Config** the library will use its own.

By default **Patches** will use its own built-in handlers for updating (Composer) and merging
(Copy). You can change to another bundled handler (or write your own) using the config values.
You can also disable unwanted aspects of the patching process (like Events). **Patches** will
also auto-detect source files and use any available, but you can specify `ignoredSources` by
their shortname (e.g. "Framework") to prevent using a source.

### Repositories

**Patches** works best alongside your project's repository management. It is highly recommended
that you add the workspace to your **.gitignore** file (default: **writable/patches**) and
that you include **composer.lock** in committed code. This way you can run patches against
a dedicated branch without affecting the rest of your workflow.

## Usage

**Patches** comes with a CLI Command to run patches and guide you through the process. After
the module is installed and configured, run "selfupdate" from the command line:

	php spark selfupdate

Follow the prompts to complete the patch process. Copies of the files are left in the workspace
(default: **ROOTPATH/writable/patches/{datetime}**) along with **codex.json**, a copy of the run log.

## Example

Below is a guided example of the patch process. This shows taking [CodeIgniter Playground](https://github.com/codeigniter4projects/playground)
from an earlier release of the framework up to version `4.0.3`.

> Add Patches to the existing project in a development setting

```
> composer require --dev tatter/patches
```
	
> All defaults are fine so kick off the patch process, which will begin with an overview of the configuration

```
> php spark selfupdate
